# Poor-file-name-finder
Bash script to find files that have "poor names" as specified by the script regular expression.

**NOTE: local downloads of poornames may create a file with CRLF line endings instead of LF. The Bash script will only work with LF line endings. Such a thing can easily be changed in VS Code**
